# Showcase console application for ClientServices
This project features a trivial CLI application using the Arcor2.ClientSdk.ClientServices library.
It maps the majority of available RPC methods to console commands, offering a convenient way to manually test and experiment with functionalities of the ARCOR2 server.

In addition to serving as a testing tool, this project also acts as a basic demonstration on how to use the library.
However, keep in mind that this implementation does not showcase every feature and mechanism of the library, 
such as ll the different overloads, data update notifications, or event handling. 
For production-level applications a more complete, object-oriented design is recommended.
